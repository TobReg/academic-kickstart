As a behavioural economist I am intrigued by all aspects of behaviour that standard neoclassical economics fails to explain. My core interest is pro-social behaviour. From a theoretical perspective I strive to shed more light on the actual drivers of pro-social behaviour. I am interested in modelling approaches that go beyond a mere focus on outcomes, by considering motivations like reciprocity, moral emotions, self-, and social-image concerns. On a more applied level I am interested in ways pro-social behaviour can have a positive impact in actual markets, especially electronic ones.
