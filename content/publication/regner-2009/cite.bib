 abstract = {The paper analyses the payment behaviour of customers of the online
music label Magnatune. Customers may pay what they want for albums,
as long as the payment is within a given price range (\$5-\$18).
Magnatune's comprehensive pre-purchase access facilitates music discovery
and allows an informed buying decision setting it apart from conventional
online music stores. On average customers pay \$8.20, far more than
the minimum of \$5 and even higher than the recommended price of \$8.
We analyse the relationship between artists/labels and customers
in online music. We consider social preferences, in particular concerns
for reciprocity. The resulting sequential reciprocity equilibrium
corresponds to the observed pattern of behaviour. We conclude that
Magnatune's open contracts design can encourage people to make voluntary
payments and may be a viable business option. },
